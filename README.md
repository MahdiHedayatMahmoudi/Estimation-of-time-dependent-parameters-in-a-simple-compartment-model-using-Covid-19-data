	# SIR_model_MaxPlanck

## Introduction
By this notebook we have tried to first calculate main parameters of SIR model during time. For tis purpose we have applied a sliding window with size of 30 days.

## DATA
For this model we have used COVId-19 data which data can be found here [DATA](https://github.com/ard-data/2020-rki-archive).
Data has not read in correct way, so some artifacts can be seen in time dependant 'b' parameter.
